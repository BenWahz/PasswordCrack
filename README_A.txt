This program goes line by line through the wordlist file, as it checks each password it encrypts it with SHA-1 and
compares it with the passwords found in passwd . when it finds a match it prints the match and its corresponding username.

The program can be tested by uncommenting line 17 and allowing the program to print every password in its encrypted form.
all that needs to be done is adding the wordlist800.txt file to get passwords from.
